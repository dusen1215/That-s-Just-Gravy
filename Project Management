  Discovery - I love gravy, and there is not enough places online I feel for people to just freely express their love for the heavenly sauce
  Design - I wanted a simple view with pictures of gravy and a design that feels homey to users
  Development - I started to work on being able to accept users' inputs into the mysql database
  Testing - I demonstrated testing through JUNIT and by putting in my own samples into the forms the application provides 
  Release - Once design is followed through to our test audience's satisfaction then we will 
  Maintenance - We have procedures once that phase meets
